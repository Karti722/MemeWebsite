# MemeWebsite
This is a website that randomly generates a meme everytime it is refreshed.
This application uses an Api from the website URL: https://meme-api.com/gimme/ .
Randomly selects a meme from four specific subreddits: ["wholesomememes", "catmemes", "dogmemes", "me_irl"].
Also added a code snippet that randomly selects a background image for the website. The image resets
each time the website is refreshed.
